# Flexcook

## Introduction
This app has a practice purpose after my completed study as Full Stack Developer.

## Setting
First of all the app will have an inventory at which the user can store the available food.
The app keeps track of the quantity of each ingredient as well as the ingredient stats (energy, fats, vitamines).

At a later stage we will add a recipe system based on the current ingredients.

At this moment we are using this image as a basic layout for the app:
